This is a weather app. The purpose of this app is to allow users to query their desired location and retrieve weather information according to that specific location. 

Code

The __backend__ will be handled by python3.6 that will handle the HTTP request to ```GET``` data from the API. For this project, I will be using Dark Sky's Weather API and MapBox for geocoding the latitude and longitude request.

The most challenging part I presume of this project will be converting the latitude and longitude into human readable addresses and vice versa. I also predict that being able to send the request from front end and backend will cause trouble as well

I have prepared to base files, one in ```javascript```, which I have experience in, and the other in ```python``` a language I am still learning, that will act as the core drivers in this project. If time is coming fast and I find that still have not progressed as far as I need to in python then I will switch to React.js and run the app from there.

UPDATED: 09/11/2018 Switched React

I switched to react because I am more familiar with the language and this is due in 3 days
