# [FirstCall - Weather App](https://firstcall-weather.surge.sh/)

A React Based Application that uses Dark Sky's web API to gather weather data and Geocodio's API to render weather conditions based on user's desired location

## Project Purpose

This is a weather app. The purpose of this app is to allow users to query their desired location and retrieve weather information according to that specific location. 

For this project, I will be using Dark Sky's Weather API and Geocodio for geocoding the latitude and longitude request.

The most challenging part I presume of this project will be converting the latitude and longitude into human readable addresses and vice versa. I also predict that being able to send the request from front end and backend will cause trouble as well

I have prepared to base files, one in ```javascript```, which I have experience in, and the other in ```python``` a language I am still learning, that will act as the core drivers in this project. If time is coming fast and I find that still have not progressed as far as I need to in python then I will switch to React.js and run the app from there.

UPDATE: 09/11/2018 Switched React
